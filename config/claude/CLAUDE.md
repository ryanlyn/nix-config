# Global Claude Code Guidelines

## General Principles

- Prefer simple, straightforward solutions over clever ones
- Make minimal changes to accomplish the task
- Document non-obvious decisions with brief comments

## Coding Standards

- Follow existing patterns and conventions in each codebase
- Write clear, self-documenting code
- Avoid over-engineering or premature abstraction

## Workflow

- Read and understand existing code before making changes
- Test changes when test infrastructure is available
- Commit atomic, focused changes with clear messages
